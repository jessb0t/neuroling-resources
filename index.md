# Datasets

intro

### ERP CORE

The ERP CORE dataset has two experiments of particular interest to neurolinguists: the N400 and the MMN. The N400 will especially appeal to those who want to investigate lexical semantics while the MMN is an important ERP in auditory processing. Participants are English speakers.

### Accent-Related Potentials

A dataset to investigate how pitch accents are processed in continuous speech. The authors created a new metric, the accent related potential (ARP), a distinct neural signature for pitch accents. Participants are monolingual English L1 and multilingual English L2, Mandarin L1 speakers.

# Tutorials

intro

### Programming with Software Carpentry

The most common programming languages for neurolinguistic data analysis are MATLAB and Python. Python and R are widely used in acoustics. R is popular for statistical modeling while Python is considered top-of-class for machine learning. With these three languages, a neurolinguist has a broad foundation on which to explore and analyze data. (Note: R and Python are both free to download and install. For MATLAB, you may have access through your institution. The actual tutorials below are free.)

### EEG Preprocessing + Simple ERPs

A series of informal trainings led by [Dr. George Buzzell](https://www.ndclab.com/) using the [MADE](https://github.com/ChildDevLab/MADE-EEG-preprocessing-pipeline) preprocessing pipeline to prepare EEG data for analysis. Use the readmes in 2021 and 2022 (in order) to access video links and materials.

### Linear Mixed Effects Modeling for Linguistics

Two very straightforward tutorials on the basics of mixed effects modeling by cognitive linguist [Dr. Bodo Winter](https://bodowinter.com/). An excellent place to start for mixed effects modeling.
