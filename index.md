intro

### ERP CORE

The ERP CORE dataset has two experiments of particular interest to neurolinguists: the N400 and the MMN. The N400 will especially appeal to those who want to investigate lexical semantics while the MMN is an important ERP in auditory processing. Participants are English speakers.
