# Datasets

The public release of datasets  is a cornerstone of open science. In this particular collection, I include only datasets that could be relevant to an investigation of linguistics-related questions and which contain neural data (EEG, MEG, FFR, ECoG, etc.). They are in no particular order. All papers are linked to the DOI or ArXiv for ease of reference, but many are also freely available via PubMed Central.

### ERP CORE

The ERP CORE dataset has two experiments of particular interest to neurolinguists: the N400 and the MMN. The N400 will especially appeal to those who want to investigate lexical semantics while the MMN is an important ERP in auditory processing. Participants are English speakers.

[OSF:N400](https://osf.io/29xpq/) –– [OSF:MMN](https://osf.io/5q4xs/) –– [Website](https://erpinfo.org/erp-core) –– [Paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465)

### Accent-Related Potentials

A dataset to investigate how pitch accents are processed in continuous speech. The authors created a new metric, the accent related potential (ARP), a distinct neural signature for pitch accents. Participants are monolingual English L1 and multilingual English L2, Mandarin L1 speakers.

[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/4721936#.YI%20dHxZBKjb1) –– [Paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2021.107883)

### Broderick Natural Listening Datasets

A collection of datasets that includes both naturalistic listening, RSVP reading, and speech in noise experiments. The paper offers details on stimuli, procedures, and participants.

### MEG-MASC

An MEG dataset in which participants (mostly English L1) listened to several stories produced by a text-to-speech synthesizer with three distinct synthetic voices and multiple speech rates.

### LeBel Natural Listening

Deep data for 8 participants who listen to multiple hours of natural stories from [The Moth Radio Hour](https://themoth.org/radio-hour) and the NYT Modern Love podcast during fMRI scanning. Extensive annotations for the podcast stimuli.

### Narratives (Nastase Natural Listening)

A large dataset (345 participants!) listening to naturalistic audio while in fMRI scanning. Extensive annotations are available for the stimulus stories.

[GitHub](https://github.com/snastase/narratives) –– [Datalad](https://datasets.datalad.org/?dir=/labs/hasson/narratives) –– [Paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-021-01033-3)

### Tang Pitch Listening | ECoG

A dataset of ECoG data from the superior temporal gyrus (STG) of 10 participants who listened to sentences with varied pitch contour, phonetic content, and synthesized speaker.

[Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.826950) –– [Paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bandl.2020.104891)

# Tutorials

Many amazing scientists have created useful (and free!) tutorials to do, well, just about anything. This is a collection of tutorials that I have found particularly useful for learning skills that support my neurolinguistic research.

### Programming with Software Carpentry

The most common programming languages for neurolinguistic data analysis are MATLAB and Python. Python and R are widely used in acoustics. R is popular for statistical modeling while Python is considered top-of-class for machine learning. With these three languages, a neurolinguist has a broad foundation on which to explore and analyze data. (Note: R and Python are both free to download and install. For MATLAB, you may have access through your institution. The actual tutorials below are free.)

[R](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/) –– [Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) –– [MATLAB](http://swcarpentry.github.io/matlab-novice-inflammation/)

### EEG Preprocessing + Simple ERPs

A series of informal trainings led by [Dr. George Buzzell](https://www.ndclab.com/) using the [MADE](https://github.com/ChildDevLab/MADE-EEG-preprocessing-pipeline) preprocessing pipeline to prepare EEG data for analysis. Use the readmes in 2021 and 2022 (in order) to access video links and materials.

[GitHub](https://github.com/NDCLab/lab-training/tree/main/eeg-analysis)

### Linear Mixed Effects Modeling for Linguistics

Two very straightforward tutorials on the basics of mixed effects modeling by cognitive linguist [Dr. Bodo Winter](https://bodowinter.com/). An excellent place to start for mixed effects modeling.

[Paper + Tutorial](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.5499.pdf)

### Neuromatch Computational Neuroscience

A thousand tutorials in one! The Neuromatch team makes their annual, three-week intensive course freely available, with videos and hands-on tutorials using Jupyter notebooks in either Google Colab or Kaggle. Ignore the "Projects" part (which is only for summer participants), and start with W0D0 (Week 0, Day 0).

### Statquest

Dr. Josh Starmer's hilarious, accessible videos can help you work through any statistical confusion.

### 3Blue1Brown

Sometimes, you just need a visual. Grant Anderson's videos will change how you view linear algebra and calculus forever.

### HarvardX Fundamentals of Neuroscience

This is a series of three online courses (free if you select the Audit Track) that offers an excellent introduction to the basics of neuroscience, including the biochemistry of how neurons work, how they function as ensembles, and how they combine to the make the brain.
